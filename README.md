* The frontend is built with **ReactJS** to create an interactive user interface. We use **Bootstrap** for styling, including modals, and **Material UI (MUI)** for a suite of customizable UI components such as pagination, tables, paper, menus, and buttons, which streamline the interface.

* The application leverages React hooks, including **useState**, **useEffect**, **useNavigate**, **useQuery**, and **useMutation**, to manage component state, side effects, and routing.

* For API interactions, we use **Apollo Client** for GraphQL queries and mutations and **Axios** for REST API requests to the server.
